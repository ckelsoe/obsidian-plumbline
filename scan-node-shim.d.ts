// Scan-only Node ambient shims. Consumed ONLY by tsconfig.scan.json (the
// marketplace-scan reproduction), never by the normal build.
//
// The scan reproduction strips @types/node (via `types: []`) so a lib-version
// gap is exposed instead of masked. That also removes the Node globals that
// desktop-only code reaches for behind a Platform.isDesktop guard (`require`,
// `Buffer`, and the `fs`/`path` modules). The hosted developer-dashboard scan
// resolves those from its Node/Electron runtime, so they are NOT what the guard
// exists to catch; these minimal shims reproduce that so the guard does not
// false-fail on them while still surfacing any lib gap (the shims declare no
// String/Array members). The normal `tsc` build excludes this file (see
// tsconfig.json `exclude`) and uses @types/node, so there is no clash. This
// file is in eslint's globalIgnores, so its `any` shims are not linted.
//
// If this plugin uses no Node built-ins, this file and its tsconfig.scan.json
// include entry can be deleted; the guard still works without it.
