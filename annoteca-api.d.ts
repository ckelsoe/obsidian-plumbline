// Vendored from ckelsoe/obsidian-annoteca (its published annoteca-api.d.ts, tracking
// main after 1.17.0). Do not edit here. To update, re-copy the file from that repo.
// Plumbline consumes Annoteca only through the runtime object this describes, resolved
// at call time, and only types its promote() call against it.
//
// Annoteca's public plugin API, as a standalone type declaration.
//
// OPTIONAL. Using the API needs nothing copied: it is a plain runtime object reached
// at `app.plugins.getPlugin('annoteca')?.api`, callable in plain JS. This file only
// gives TypeScript consumers the types, with no imports and no runtime, so copying it
// adds no dependency. See API.md for the full guide.
//
// Resolve the API at CALL time, never in your onload. `app.plugins` is an Obsidian
// internal the official types do not declare, so reach it through a minimal local
// shape; API.md has a lookup that compiles against the stock types plus this file
// alone. Gate on `apiVersion >= 3` and degrade below it.
//
// Caching it is the only thing that makes plugin load order matter, and
// `isEnabled('annoteca')` is not an availability test (it reports saved config, so
// it answers true for a disabled, unloaded plugin). Availability is
// `getPlugin('annoteca') !== null` plus an `apiVersion` check.
//
// This file is kept byte-compatible with the shipped runtime surface by a locking
// test in the plugin's own repo, so what a consumer copies is what the plugin
// exposes.

// A comment as a consumer sees it. Deliberately narrow: it does not carry the
// marker grammar or the reply and addressed structures the file format needs, so
// none of those become something the API can never change.
